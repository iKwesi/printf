# printf
This is a group project for the alx-africa Software Engineering programme

Have you ever wondered how printf() function works in C? It is a very useful function that allows you to print strings and formatted data on the screen. You might have used it many times, but have you ever thought about how it works behind the scenes?

_printf is a project that replicates the printf() function in C. It is part of the first-year curriculum of ALX, a software engineering program. In this project, you will learn how to work in a team using Git, apply variadic functions to a big project, manage many files, and find a good workflow.

What is _printf?
_printf is a function that takes a string of characters, formats them, and prints them to the screen. It is very similar to the printf() function in the C standard library, but it is custom-made by the ALX team. The function is a variadic function, which means it takes a variable number of arguments.

How to Use _printf?
To use _printf, you need to call it with a format string and the data you want to print. The format string contains conversion specifiers and flags, along with regular characters. Conversion specifiers are special characters that tell _printf what type of data you want to print, and flags modify the output. Here are some examples of how to use _printf:

perl
Copy code
_printf("Hello, main\n"); // prints "Hello, Main", followed by a new line
_printf("%s", "Hello"); // prints "Hello"
_printf("This is a number: %d", 98); // prints "This is a number: 98"
Tasks
The _printf project consists of several tasks, each of which adds a new feature to the function. Here is a summary of the tasks:

- Implement the conversion specifiers "c" and "s"
- Implement the conversion specifiers "d" and "i"
- Create a man page for the function
- Implement the conversion specifier "b"
- Use a local buffer to minimize calls to the write function
- Implement the custom conversion specifier "S"
- Implement the conversion specifier "p"
- Implement the flags "+", " ", and "#"
- Implement the length modifiers "l" and "h"
- Implement the field width flag
- Implement the precision flag
- Implement the "0" flag
- Implement the "-" flag
- Implement the custom conversion specifier "r"
- Implement the custom conversion specifier "R"
- Each task builds upon the previous ones, so it is important to complete them in order.

Conclusion
_printf is a project that replicates the printf() function in C. It is an excellent way to learn how to work in a team using Git, apply variadic functions to a big project, manage many files, and find a good workflow. By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of how printf() works and how to create your own custom functions in C. Good luck!
